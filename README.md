# hls.js
hls.js is a JavaScript library which implements an [HTTP Live Streaming] client.
It relies on [HTML5 video][] and [MediaSource Extensions][] for playback.

it works by transmuxing MPEG-2 Transport Stream into ISO BMFF (MP4) fragments.
this transmuxing could be performed asynchronously using [Web Worker] if available in the browser.

hls.js does not need any player, it works directly on top of a standard HTML```<video>```element.
 
hls.js is written in [ECMAScript6], and transpiled in ECMAScript5 using [Babel].

## player integration

hls.js is (being) integrated in the following players:

 - [Clappr] (https://github.com/clappr/clappr), integrated since [0.2.14](https://github.com/clappr/clappr/releases)
 - [Flowplayer] (https://www.flowplayer.org)  through [flowplayer-hlsjs
] (https://github.com/flowplayer/flowplayer-hlsjs)
 - [Videojs] (http://videojs.com) through [Videojs-hlsjs] (https://github.com/benjipott/videojs-hlsjs)

 it might also be integrated in the following players if you push for it !

 - [MediaElement.js] (http://mediaelementjs.com/)  through [#1609
] (https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1609)
 

## Dependencies

No external JS libs are needed. 
prepackaged build is included in the [dist] (dist) folder:

 - [hls.js] (dist/hls.js)
 - [hls.min.js] (dist/hls.min.js)

if you want to bundle the application yourself, use node

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js.git
# setup dev environnement
cd hls.js
npm install
# build dist/hls.js, watch file change for rebuild and launch demo page
npm run dev
# lint
npm run lint
# minify
npm run minify
```

## Installation

either directly include dist/hls.js or dist/hls.min.js

or type

```sh
npm install --save https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js
```

## Compatibility
 hls.js is compatible with browsers supporting MSE with 'video/MP4' inputs.
as of today, it is supported on:

 * Chrome for Android 34+
 * Chrome for Desktop 34+
 * Firefox for Desktop 38+ (with ```media.mediasource.whitelist=false``` in about:config)
 * IE11+ for Windows 8.1
 * Safari for Mac 8+ (beta)

## Features

  - VoD & Live playlists
    - DVR support on Live playlists
  - MPEG-2 TS container  
  - Adaptive streaming
    - Manual & Auto Quality Switching
      - 3 Quality Switching modes are available (controllable through API means)
      	- instant switching (immediate quality switch at current video position)
      	- smooth switching (quality switch for next loaded fragment)
      	- bandwidth conservative switching (quality switch change for next loaded fragment, without flushing the buffer)
      - in Auto-Quality mode, emergency switch down in case bandwidth is suddenly dropping to minimize buffering.        
  - Accurate Seeking on VoD & Live (not limited to fragment or keyframe boundary)
  - ability to seek in buffer and back buffer without redownloading segments
  - Built-in Analytics
    - every internal events could be monitored (Network Events,Video Events)
    - playback session metrics are also exposed
  - resilience to errors
    - retry mechanism embedded in the library
    - recovery actions could be triggered fix fatal media or network errors
  - [Redundant/Failover Playlists](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StreamingMediaGuide/UsingHTTPLiveStreaming/UsingHTTPLiveStreaming.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008332-CH102-SW22)
  - Timed Metadata for HTTP Live Streaming (in ID3 format, carried in MPEG-2 TS)
  - AES-128 decryption (AES-128 mode)

## Not Supported (Yet)

  - AAC / MP3 / WebVTT container
  - Alternate Audio Track Rendition (Master Playlist with alternative Audio)  

### Supported M3U8 tags

  - `#EXTM3U`
  - `#EXTINF`
  - `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF` (adaptive streaming)
  - `#EXT-X-ENDLIST` (Live playlist)
  - `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE`
  - `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION`
  - `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`
  - `#EXT-X-BYTERANGE`
  - `#EXT-X-KEY` (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-08#section-3.4.4)

## Getting Started

```js
<script src="dist/hls.js"></script>
<video id="video"></video>
<script>
  if(Hls.isSupported()) {
    var video = document.getElementById('video');
    var hls = new Hls();
    hls.loadSource('http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8');
    hls.attachMedia(video);
    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED,function() {
      video.play();
  });
 }
</script>
```

## Video Control

video is controlled through HTML ```<video>``` element.

HTMLVideoElement control and events could be used seamlessly.


## API and Configuration Parameters

hls.js can be configured and controlled easily, click [here](API.md) for details.


## License

  hls.js is released under [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Here is a quick guide on how to start.

 - Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) or at least stay consistent to the file formats defined in the `.editorconfig` file.
 - Develop in a topic branch, not master
 - Don't commit the updated `dist/hls.js` file in your PR. We'll take care of generating an updated build right before releasing a new tagged version.
