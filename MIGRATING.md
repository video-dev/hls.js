# Migrating from hls.js 0.x to 1.x

This guide provides an overview to migrating an application using hls.js from v0.14.x to v1.0.0.

## Dependencies

Promise support is now required. Please bring your own polyfill.

## Configuration Changes

cleared by hls.js than leaving it up to the browser. Set `backBufferLength`

- `backBufferLength` default of 90 seconds applies to Live and VOD streams. `liveBackBufferLength` is still supported but marked as deprecated. Back buffer on VOD content will be to `Infinity` and the deprecated `liveBackBufferLength` to 90 to enforce the old behavior.
- `lowLatencyMode` - set to `false` to disable Low-latency part loading and target latency playback rate adjustment
- `progressive`- (experimental) set to `true` to stream and append loaded audio and video data before each segment load completion. Not recommended for production or small segments with only a single GoP or less.

## Support for Group-Level Track Switching

- `hls.audioTracks` and `hls.subtitleTracks` as well as `AUDIO_TRACKS_UPDATED` and `SUBTITLE_TRACKS_UPDATED` events only list tracks in the active level's audio/sub GROUP-ID after `LEVEL_LOADING` (this will go unnoticed for streams with no or only one group per track type)
  - The `MANIFEST_PARSED` event still reports all tracks when multiple GROUP-ID values are present. Applications that used that event to get tracks would need to be updated in v1 to switch to the corresponding track update events to select available tracks using the available indexes.
  - Track ids are no longer indexes of the complete list of audio or subtitle tracks. They are now indexes within each group. So six tracks in two groups that had ids 0,1,2,3,4,5 will now have ids 0,1,2,0,1,2. This allows for tracks to be changed by index/id within the range of available tracks as they were before.
- Added `groupId` to audio and subtitle track loading and loaded events

## Playback and Level Changes

- Setting `hls.currentLevel` no longer pauses the media element while clearing the buffer and loading the new level. This can result in a stall error if playback doesn't start within a quarter of a second. Applications implementing manual quality switching with `hls.currentLevel` that do not want a stall reported should either pause or set `video.playbackRate` to `0` until the level switch is complete.

## Event Changes

Event order and content have changed in some places. See **Breaking Changes** below, and please report any issues with breaking changes that impact your integrations

- `FRAG_LOADED` fires after events handled on progress which can include everything up to appending a fragment if workers are disabled (more details below under **Known Issues**)
- `BUFFER_CODECS` data has changed from `{ tracks: { video?, audio? } }` to simply `{ video?, audio? }`
- `BUFFER_APPENDING` data has changed from `{ type, data, parent, content }` to `{ type, data, frag, chunkMeta }`
- `BUFFER_APPENDED` data has changed
- `FRAG_DECRYPT_ERROR` events are now surfaced as a `FRAG_PARSING_ERROR` along with other fragment transmuxing errors
- Added additional error details to help identify the source of certain network error events:
  - `SUBTITLE_LOAD_ERROR`
  - `SUBTITLE_TRACK_LOAD_TIMEOUT`
  - `UNKNOWN`

### Fragment Stats

- The `stats` object has changed
  - `trequest`, `tfirst`, `tload` have been replaced by `loading: HlsProgressivePerformanceTiming`
  - `tparsed` has been replaced by `parsing: HlsProgressivePerformanceTiming`
- On the `Fragment` object:
  - `hasElementaryStream` function has been removed
  - `setElementaryStream` and `_elementaryStreams` have been renamed (these are only for internal use)

### LL-HLS Parts in events

- FRAG\_\_\_\_ events are now fired for LL-HLS part events with a `part` property that include the part details.
