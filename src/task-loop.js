/**
 * Sub-class specialization of EventHandler base class.
 *
 * TaskLoop allows to schedule a task function being called repeatedly on the main loop,
 * scheduled asynchroneously, avoiding recursive calls in the same tick.
 *
 * It will be assured that the task execution method only gets called once per main loop tick,
 * no matter how often it gets requested for execution. Execution in further ticks will be scheduled accordingly.
 *
 * The task can be scheduled as an interval repeatedly with a period as parameter.
 *
 * Sub-classes need to implement the doTick method which will effectively have the task execution routine.
 *
 * The class has a tick function that will schedule the doTick call. It may be called synchroneously
 * only for a stack-depth of one. On re-entrant calls, sub-sequent calls are scheduled for next main loop ticks.
 *
 * When the task execution ("tick" method) is called in re-entrant way this is detected and
 * we are limiting the task execution per call stack to exactly one, but scheduling/post-poning further
 * task processing on the next main loop iteration (also known as "next tick" in the Node/JS runtime lingo).
