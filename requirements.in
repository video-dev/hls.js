# This file is used to generate requirements.txt.
# To update requirements.txt, run the following commands.
# Use Python 3.6 when creating the environment or using pip-tools
# 1) pip install pip-tools
# 2) pip-compile --generate-hashes --upgrade pythonFiles\jedilsp_requirements\requirements.in

# We don't need to add Python version restrictions
# since we don't support anything older than 3.6 anymore,
# However, make sure to use Python 3.6 when running pip-compile,
# so that all Python 3.6-specific requirements are captured when generating requirements.txt.
