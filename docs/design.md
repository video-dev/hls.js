## Design principle

design idea is pretty simple :

- main functionalities are split into several subsystems
- all subsystems are instantiated by the Hls instance.
- each subsystem heavily relies on events for internal/external communications.
- Events are handled using [EventEmitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3)
- bundled for the browser by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Code structure

- [src/config.js][]
  - definition of default Hls Config. entry point for conditional compilation (altaudio/subtitle)
- [src/errors.js][]
  - definition of Hls.ErrorTypes and Hls.ErrorDetails
- [src/event-handler.ts][]
  - helper class simplifying Hls event handling, event error catching
- [src/events.js][]
  - definition of Hls.Events
- [src/hls.js][]
  - definition of Hls Class. instantiate all subcomponents. conditionally instantiate optional subcomponents.
- [src/index.js][]
  - needed for ES6 export
- [src/controller/abr-controller.js][]
  - in charge of determining auto quality level.
  - auto quality switch algorithm is bitrate based : fragment loading bitrate is monitored and smoothed using 2 exponential weighted moving average (a fast one, to adapt quickly on bandwidth drop and a slow one, to avoid ramping up too quickly on bandwidth increase)
  - in charge of **monitoring fragment loading speed** (by monitoring the amount of data received from fragment loader `stats.loaded` counter)
  - "expected time of fragment load completion" is computed using "fragment loading instant bandwidth".
  - this time is compared to the "expected time of buffer starvation".
  - if we have less than 2 fragments buffered and if "expected time of fragment load completion" is bigger than "expected time of buffer starvation" and also bigger than duration needed to load fragment at next quality level (determined by auto quality switch algorithm), current fragment loading is aborted, and a FRAG_LOAD_EMERGENCY_ABORTED event is triggered. this event will be handled by stream-controller.
- [src/controller/audio-stream-controller.js][]
  - audio stream controller is in charge of filling audio buffer in case alternate audio tracks are used
  - if buffer is not filled up appropriately (i.e. as per defined maximum buffer size, it will trigger the following actions:
    - retrieve "not buffered" media position greater then current playback position. this is performed by comparing audio sourcebuffer.buffered and media.currentTime.
    - retrieve URL of fragment matching with this media position, and appropriate audio track
    - trigger KEY_LOADING event (only if fragment is encrypted)
    - trigger FRAG_LOADING event
    - **trigger fragment demuxing** on FRAG_LOADED
    - trigger BUFFER_CODECS on FRAG_PARSING_INIT_SEGMENT
    - trigger BUFFER_APPENDING on FRAG_PARSING_DATA
    - once FRAG_PARSED is received an all segments have been appended (BUFFER_APPENDED) then audio stream controller will recheck whether it needs to buffer more data.
- [src/controller/audio-track-controller.js][]
  - audio track controller is handling alternate audio track set/get ((re)loading tracks/switching)
- [src/controller/buffer-controller.js][]
  - in charge of:
    - resetting media buffer upon BUFFER_RESET event reception
    - initializing [SourceBuffer](http://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/#sourcebuffer) with appropriate codecs info upon BUFFER_CODECS event reception
    - appending MP4 boxes in [SourceBuffer](http://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/#sourcebuffer) upon BUFFER_APPENDING
    - trigger BUFFER_APPENDED event upon successful buffer appending
    - flushing specified buffer range upon reception of BUFFER_FLUSHING event
    - trigger BUFFER_FLUSHED event upon successful buffer flushing
- [src/controller/cap-level-controller.js][]
  - in charge of determining best quality level to actual size (dimensions: width and height) of the player
- [src/controller/fps-controller.js][]
  - in charge of monitoring frame rate, and fire FPS_DROP event in case FPS drop exceeds configured threshold. disabled for now.
- [src/controller/id3-track-controller.js](../src/controller/id3-track-controller.js)
  - in charge of creating the id3 metadata text track and adding cues to that track in response to the FRAG_PARSING_METADATA event. the raw id3 data is base64 encoded and stored in the cue's text property.
- [src/controller/level-controller.js][]

  - handling quality level set/get ((re)loading stream manifest/switching levels)
  - in charge of scheduling playlist (re)loading
  - monitors fragment and key loading errors. Performs fragment hunt by switching between primary and backup streams and down-shifting a level till `fragLoadingMaxRetry` limit is reached.
  - monitors level loading errors. Performs level hunt by switching between primary and backup streams and down-shifting a level till `levelLoadingMaxRetry` limit is reached.
  - periodically refresh active live playlist

  **Feature: Media Zigzagging**

  If there is a backup stream, Media Zigzagging will go through all available levels in `primary` and `backup` streams. Behavior has a dual constraint, where fragment retry limits and level limits are accounted in the same time.
  When the lowest level has been reached, zigzagging will be adjusted to start from the highest level until retry limits are not reached.

  ![Media Zigzagging Explanation](./media-zigzagging.png)

  Where: F - Bad Fragment, L - Bad Level

  **Retry Recommendations**

  By not having multiple renditions, recovery logic will not be able to add extra value to your platform. In order to have good results for dual constraint media hunt, specify big enough limits for fragments and levels retries.

  - Level: don't use total retry less than `3 - 4`
  - Fragment: don't use total retry less than `4 - 6`
  - Implement short burst retries (i.e. small retry delay `0.5 - 4` seconds), and when library returns fatal error switch to a different CDN

- [src/controller/stream-controller.js][]
  - stream controller is in charge of:
    - triggering BUFFER_RESET on MANIFEST_PARSED or startLoad()
    - **ensuring that media buffer is filled as per defined quality selection logic**.
  - if buffer is not filled up appropriately (i.e. as per defined maximum buffer size, or as per defined quality level), stream controller will trigger the following actions:
    - retrieve "not buffered" media position greater then current playback position. this is performed by comparing video.buffered and video.currentTime.
      - if there are holes in video.buffered, smaller than config.maxBufferHole, they will be ignored.
    - retrieve appropriate quality level through hls.nextLoadLevel getter
    - then setting hls.nextLoadLevel (this will force level-controller to retrieve level details if not available yet)
    - retrieve fragment (and its URL) matching with this media position, using binary search on level details
    - trigger KEY_LOADING event (only if fragment is encrypted)
    - trigger FRAG_LOADING event
    - **trigger fragment demuxing** on FRAG_LOADED
    - trigger BUFFER_CODECS on FRAG_PARSING_INIT_SEGMENT
    - trigger BUFFER_APPENDING on FRAG_PARSING_DATA
    - once FRAG_PARSED is received an all segments have been appended (BUFFER_APPENDED) then buffer controller will recheck whether it needs to buffer more data.
    - **monitor current playback quality level** (buffer controller maintains a map between media position and quality level)
    - **monitor playback progress** : if playhead is not moving for more than `config.highBufferWatchdogPeriod` although it should (video metadata is known and video is not ended, nor paused, nor in seeking state) and if we have less than 500ms buffered upfront, one of two things will happen.
      - if there is a known malformed fragment then hls.js will **jump over the buffer hole** and seek to the beginning the next playable buffered range.
      - hls.js will nudge currentTime until playback recovers (it will retry every seconds, and report a fatal error after config.maxNudgeRetry retries)
        500 ms is a "magic number" that has been set to overcome browsers not always stopping playback at the exact end of a buffered range.
        these holes in media buffered are often encountered on stream discontinuity or on quality level switch. holes could be "large" especially if fragments are not starting with a keyframe.
  - convert non-fatal `FRAG_LOAD_ERROR`/`FRAG_LOAD_TIMEOUT`/`KEY_LOAD_ERROR`/`KEY_LOAD_TIMEOUT` error into fatal error when media position is not buffered and max load retry has been reached
  - stream controller actions are scheduled by a tick timer (invoked every 100ms) and actions are controlled by a state machine.
